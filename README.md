- 👋 Hi, I’m @HermannWilhelm
- 👀 I’m interested in:
    - complexity theory (I did my master thesis about the complexity of counting homomorphisms)
    - programming with mathematica and bash (I have done a lot of programming for fun and would like to work on something serious)
    - psychology (Alice Miller, Somatic Experiencing, NARM).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to solve the monge-ampere equation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on programming mathmatics algorithms in my favorite programming language mathematica.
